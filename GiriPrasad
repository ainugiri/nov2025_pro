PULL vs Clone
Clone - Only one time, copy entire repo(all branches, set remote url)
Pull -  We need add remote repo, git pull with branch, it will get the particular branch, use it continuously, to get the updated files from remote, use git pull.



Now we are updating this file. 
Instead git pull, execute git clone - create another repo
